# chatroom
## Stage One (by Mar 26)
Stage one includes the following functions:
- `Zhijing` do_User()
- `Zihao` do_List()
- `Zhijing` part of the do_Join() function, which involves the interactions between the P2PChat program and
the Room server in handling the JOIN request and the subsequent JOIN requests in the KEEPALIVE procedure. To show that the program has successfully joined the chatroom, it simply displays the membersâ€™ info to the Command Window.
- `Zihao` do_Poke()

## Stage Two (by Mar 28)
- `Zhijing` do_Join()
- do_Send()
- `Zhijing` do_Quit() 

## Note
In `do_Join()`, sometimes there is an error message in parse_members(). Need to fix.
